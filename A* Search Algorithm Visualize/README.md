# 🌟 A* Pathfinding Visualizer 🌟

Welcome to the **A* Pathfinding Visualizer**! This project showcases the **A* search algorithm** in an interactive and visually appealing way. It's built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, allowing users to experiment with different grid configurations, place obstacles, and watch the algorithm in action as it finds the optimal path between two points.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This visualizer allows you to:
- Place a **Start** and **End** point on a grid.
- Add **Walls** (obstacles) that the algorithm needs to avoid.
- Watch the **A* Algorithm** dynamically find the shortest path from Start to End.
- Visually differentiate between **Open** nodes, **Closed** nodes, and the **Optimal Path**.
- **Reset** the grid to try new configurations!

## 📊 A* Algorithm Explanation

The **A* (A-star) Algorithm** is a widely used pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. It is known for its efficiency in finding the shortest path between two points.

The key formula used in A* is:
- **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)**  
  Where:
  - `g(n)` is the cost from the start node to node `n`.
  - `h(n)` is the heuristic that estimates the cost from node `n` to the goal node.

### Why A*?  
A* is faster than traditional algorithms like Dijkstra’s because it uses a **heuristic** to guide its search, making it more efficient in many cases.

## 🌈 Visual Design

- The grid cells change colors dynamically to show the algorithm's process:
  - **Green**: Start Node
  - **Red**: End Node
  - **Black**: Wall/Obstacle
  - **Light Blue**: Open nodes being explored
  - **Blue**: Closed nodes that have already been evaluated
  - **Yellow**: Final path from Start to End

## 🎮 How to Use the Visualizer

1. **Choose Start and End Points**:
   - Click on any cell to set the start point (green) and the end point (red).

2. **Add Walls**:
   - Click on any other cells to add walls (black), which the algorithm will avoid.

3. **Run A* Algorithm**:
   - Click the **Start A* Algorithm** button to watch the algorithm find the shortest path!

4. **Reset the Grid**:
   - Click the **Reset Grid** button to clear the grid and start fresh.
