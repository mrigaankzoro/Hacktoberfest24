Input:

Start by reading a list of numbers from the user input, where numbers are separated by spaces.
Check for Empty List:

If the list is empty, return None to indicate there are no elements to compare.
Initialize Largest Number:

Set the first element of the list as the initial largest number.
Traverse the List:

Iterate through the list starting from the first element:
For each element, compare it with the current largest number.
If the current element is greater than the largest number, update the largest number.
Output:

After traversing the entire list, return the largest number.
If the list was empty, print a message indicating the list was empty.
End.

Step-by-Step Example:
Input: user_input = "5 10 3 15 7"

Convert it to a list: arr = [5, 10, 3, 15, 7].
Initialize:

Set the first number (5) as the largest number.
Iterate:

Compare 5 (largest) with 5: no change.
Compare 5 (largest) with 10: update largest to 10.
Compare 10 (largest) with 3: no change.
Compare 10 (largest) with 15: update largest to 15.
Compare 15 (largest) with 7: no change.
Output:

The largest number is 15.
